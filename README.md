## 1. Project Overview<a name="intro"></a>
This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.
Not all users receive the same offer, and that was the challenge to solve with this data set.
Our task is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.

## 2. Problem Statement<a name="ps"></a>
Goal of this whole project is to understand which offers to send out to which customer and predict whether a customer will respond to an offer or not.

## 3. Installations<a name="installation"></a>
This project was written in Python using Anaconda's Jupyter Notebook. The relevant Python packages for this project are as follows:

- pandas
- numpy
- math
- json
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn.model_selection (train_test_split module)
- sklearn.preprocessing (StandardScaler )

I'd like to thank UDACITY for providing me the opportunity to learn and implement the learnings throughout the project. With that - play around with the code as much as you like!
